### What we have accomplished so far
* __Multi-currency portfolio__: Positions in different currencies can be grouped in the same portfolio. Portfolio book currency can be updated on-the-fly.
* __Multi-portfolio aggregation__: Each portfolio can have unlimited layers of sub-portfolios. All descendants' performance are aggregated in a single view.
* __User data overrides__: User can override any prices from the system to for their own calculation, without affecting others.
* __Snapshot-based portfolio construction__: An existing portfolio can be replicated in minutes by inputting only the current holdings, regardless the number of past transactions. User can add transactions later and the portfolio seamlessly updates its historical performance.
